## FWF ESPRIT Proposal LaTeX Template

A LaTeX template for Austrian FWF (Ã–sterreichischer Wissenschaftsfonds) proposals. While specifically made for ESPRIT proposals, it could be adapted for other proposals as well.

Based on a fork of the excellent [DFG Proposal Template](https://github.com/hoelzer/dfg) by [@hoelzer](https://github.com/hoelzer). Check out that repo if you want details on how to get the most out of the template.
